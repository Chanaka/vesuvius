// Vesuvius 0.9 Installation Instructions
==============================================

Currently, Vesuvius lacks an installer, so the installation process is done manually.
Please follow the steps below to instantiate an instance of Vesuvius >>

1) Get the codebase (you have it already, since you're reading this?)

Check out the codebase from launchpad >>
https://code.launchpad.net/~sahanaphp-committers/sahana-agasti/1.0

(or download a packaged version) from >>
https://launchpad.net/sahana-agasti/+download



2) Create a configuration file. You can do this by going to /conf and manually copying
the sahana.conf.example file into a new file sahana.conf --- afterwards, edit the settings
of this new file to your liking.



3) Create an .htaccess file in your /www directory. There is an example there in the same
location: .htaccess.example ~ copy it to .htaccess and then begin to modify the file. You
may or may not even need to edit it, depending on where your site is located. Specifically,
refer to these lines:

##### for when Sahana is installed on a virtual host at root level ie. http://domain.com/
RewriteBase /

##### for when Sahana is installed in a user homedir ie. http://domain.gov/~gmiernicki/sahanaDev/www/
#RewriteBase /~gmiernicki/sahanaDev/www/

If your site is running on the root path of a domain, you will not have to change anything.
You are good to go with the default example file. Else, your site is running on a non-root
path, comment out the first RewriteBase line, uncomment out the second one, and then update
its path to the path of your installation.



4) Create a new MySQL Database on your server. Assign a new user to the database. Edit
the sahana.conf file from the previous step with the new database settings.



5) Import an initial database. You can do this in a number of tools, for example:
PHPMyAdmin, MySQL Admin, or from a shell with the mysql command. The default database to
use in the file /backups/vesuviusStarterDB.sql



6) Create a folder /www/tmp (this is the cache folder Sahana uses for many things) and
appropriately change the permissions of the file so it is writable by the web server.
This can be done by executing the commands below:

cd www ;
mkdir tmp ;
chmod 777 tmp ;



7) If you wish to use the snapshot module for database backups and restores, then you
must also update the permissions on the /backups folder:

chmod 777 backups ;



8) If you did everything above correctly, you should be able to navigate to the site
and login >>

username: root
password: Agasti2011

After login, it would be adviseable to go to My Settings and then Change My Password
to alter the default password and add a bit of security to your site.
