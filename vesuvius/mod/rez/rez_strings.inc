_t('RESOURCE_PAGES_TITLE|How do I search for a person?')
_t('RESOURCE_PAGES_CONTENT|<h2>Searching</h2>
1) Enter a name in the search box<br>
2) Click on the "Search" button, or hit Enter <br>
<br>
<i>Examples:</i><br>
<br>
 Joseph Doe<br>
 Doe, Jane<br>
 Joseph Joe Joey<br>
<br>
It is best to leave off titles (â€œDr.â€, â€œMrs.â€) and suffixes (â€œJrâ€) at this time.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Search Options</h2>
Once you have performed a search, you may also limit your results by status, gender, and age.<br>
<br>
Status choices are missing (blue), alive and well (green), injured (red), deceased (black), found (brown) or unknown (gray).<br>
<br>
Gender choices are male, female, and other/unknown.<br>
<br>
Age choices are 0-17, 18+, or unknown.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Results</h2>
Results include any of the search terms.<br>
<br>
Under the search box is the number of records found that match your search, and the total number in the database (eg, Found 2 out of 43).<br>
<br>
You may sort your results by Time, Name, Age, or Status.<br>
<br>
Interactive mode displays photos by page.  The default is 25 per page.  You may change it to 50 or 100 per page via the pull down menu at the top of the results.<br>
<br>
Hands Free mode displays photos as three as three scrolling rows of photographs.  The photos always distribute themselves evenly among the rows, starting at the right side and from top row to bottom.  If there are more images than can be shown at once, the rows will become animated to scroll horizontally with wrap-around.  There is no meaning to the ordering of the images at this time.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Getting Details about a Given Photo</h2>
Click on the photo for more information.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Pause and Play Buttons</h2>
If horizontal scrolling is occurring, Pause will stop that, and Play will resume it.  Even while paused, the search will be repeated every minute to look for fresh content.<br>
<br>
<br>
